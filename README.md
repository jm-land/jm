# Next

This is the Source Code for nextc (the next compiler), parcel (the next package manager), and nextup (the next module manager).

## Building

Next is not a built language itself, although we sometimes use programs like Numba to speed up or build the code.

## Compiling Code

Currently, Next is in full design-mode. We dont expect to currently pick up users due to us bringing out breaking changes frequently without warning.

## Some Notes
In the current state, we don't recommend using the language for anything but testing. it is unstable, non-finished and lacking support for some features, i.e. Asynchronus Programming, Memory Management, Networking, etc,
